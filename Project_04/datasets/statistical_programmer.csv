 ***PMDC Field Engineers need to have a good understanding of the product’s capabilities, features, services and options that the PMDC applications and its tools can provide.   ***PMDC is a suite of products and several tools.   ***Most people erroneously just think of it as just a Client app.   ***PMDC has a Server component, a Client, over 60 Interfaces, Remote Administration, Reports, diagnostics, Records Archiving/Purging, Backup, and hundreds of configuration options that are available on each application.   ***There is also a Reporting component, which has reached end-of-life and is maintained by Eldar Gousseinov (FBR Software Engineer)   ***Then there are also the PMDC CustomPacks, which are the components that contain all the forms and customization that mobile users interact with.   ***Each CustomPack is unique for each site and there could be variations depending on the Customer’s network/s, type of GPS device/s, screen resolution/s, department/s and capabilities.    

The PMDC Field Engineers need to be capable of handling the full PMDC deployment form the beginning, until the project reaches System Acceptance and it is handled to Support. I will list some of the obvious skills: They need to understand what the contract entails. They need to educate the customer about what they purchased. They need to explain and show customers what the PMDC product can and what it will do; how it will behave and how it can be tailored to work ‘best’ for their organization. They need to know what PMDC offers as a standard and what can be requested as “extras”. They need to gather the specific system requirements to understand what needs to be enabled, what needs to be configured, and what needs to be optimized. They need to understand the customer’s polices for passwords, account management, backup, disaster recovery and how to setup all the different PMDC components to work in accordance to these policies. They need to have sessions with the Customer and the officers to understand what they want, what they need, and then how to then ‘build’ a PMDC Client CustomPack that will work best for them. They need to know PMDC operates with other systems like CAD, State, RMS, Messaging, Chat, Internet/Intranet. They need to know what to configure, what forms and setting they need to use, in order to operate with each system’s specifications and versions. They need to run through the system integration, testing, and refinement phases. They need to know how to collect diagnostics and use them to trouble-shoot problems on their own. They need to know how to edit HTML, XML, and CSS by hand (no tools). They need to know how to use the Standard PAKs to compare and bring over the necessary forms and settings to the CustomPack they are building. They will need to edit the Client’s Access database by hand to tailor the CustomPack. They need to know VB and Java scripting, to modify queries, since most customers will need variations. They need to know produce embedded functions to offer customized messages, dropdowns, and validation. They need to test, track issues, and work with Engineering when the implementation of a patch is required. They need to be familiar with the documentation, the Compass resources, the Settings documents, and were to find answers. They need to know how to perform silent installations and configure the Client’s Setup.ini for unattended mode. They need to know how to configure and integrate different GPS devices with the PMDC Client. They need to know how to integrate the ATMM mapping application.
