We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to work in a small, agile team at the NASA Research Park on SGT, Inc.’s multi-year QUASAR project (Quantifiable Assurance Cases for Trusted Autonomy), part of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Assured Autonomy research program.The successful candidate will undertake fundamental research into the foundations of Dynamic Assurance Cases (DACs), which aim to provide quantified assurance of trustworthiness in the design and operations of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (LE-CPSs), for two autonomous system platforms.The postdoctoral researcher selected for this position will be responsible for directly contributing to two core research components of the assurance quantification work under QUASAR:
Developing suitable, quantifiable measures that relate to the assurance properties of an LE-CPS, in particular safety and correctness, with particular focus on the learning/autonomy functionality;
Developing and applying models for quantification of the assurance measures, based on risk scenarios, and the elements of a dynamic assurance case (DAC), along with data obtained from engineering analysis, verification, and operational/runtime monitoring. It is expected that the quantification approach will leverage a probabilistic approach so as to provide a rigorous, formal treatment of uncertainty, and to capture the stochastic nature of the overall system.
In addition to basic research, the researcher will apply the assurance quantification approach developed to the LE-CPS platforms within the Assured Autonomy Program, as part of the overall demonstration effort. In so doing, performing system and software safety analysis, developing risk scenarios, and undertaking risk assessment and apportionment may be required. The researcher would thus be expected to balance and contribute to both the research goals, and the practical engineering efforts within QUASAR. The successful candidatee will also contribute to implementation of the research results by designing algorithms and specifying the functionality required for implementing the assurance quantification approach in AdvoCATE, the Assurance Case Automation Toolset, for developing DACs. This is an opportunity to be involved at the leading edge of safety engineering and assurance technology, as applied to autonomous systems.Required Skills
Deep knowledge of, and substantial working experience with, probabilistic modeling and analysis, in particular Bayesian probability and statistics, and uncertainty modeling, propagation, and analysis.
Familiarity with graphical probabilistic models, e.g., Bayesian Networks, Dynamic Bayesian Networks, and Markov models.
Familiarity with the application of static/dynamic fault trees, event trees, and probabilistic models to safety and reliability analysis.
Working knowledge of dependability and safety analysis techniques and principles.
Working experience with developing, implementing, and applying statistical inference algorithms using packages/languages such as R, MATLAB/Bayes Net Toolbox, Java.
Understanding of, or ability to quickly assimilate and understand, assurance technologies and assurance foundations.
Excellent spoken and written English language communication skills.
Experience presenting research results to a research scientist audience.
Ability to contribute to research papers appropriate to relevant journals and conferences.
Other Desired Skills 
Familiarity with argument-based assurance and safety cases.
Experience applying probabilistic modeling and analysis techniques to engineering systems, in particular software-based systems.
Familiarity with machine learning techniques and algorithms.
