As a leading worldwide provider of navigation devices and wearable technology, our focus is on developing, designing and supporting superior products. Our advanced technology promotes performance, safety and ease of use in every market we serve. That makes us an engineering and technology company with a keen focus on recruiting talent in those fields. But the same vertical integration business model that keeps all design and manufacturing processes in-house also gives us the incentive to hire top performers from diverse backgrounds, including operations, finance and accounting, information technology, sales, marketing and communications.At Garmin, we create products that solve complex problems and make people’s lives safer, healthier and more enjoyable. If you are interested in developing software using C and C++, we have a future for you.We are looking for a full time Embedded Software Engineer for algorithms with a passion for building innovative algorithms to enable the best touch user experience in our embedded wearable and fitness products. You will get to think outside of the box, while working on novel ideas to build a touch interface that is optimized for low power, while still maintaining exceptional performance and responsiveness in harsh environments that our users expect. So, put your theoretical knowledge and practical skills into practice developing innovative touch algorithms that enable our most challenging use cases from glove use to sweat and water rejection.Responsibilities:
Invent touch algorithms that solve complex user use cases, borrowing ideas from digital signal processing, digital communications, statistics, machine learning, or other math familiar to you
Quickly prototype and refine these algorithms in an environment like MATLAB, R or SciPy
Implement these algorithms in C or C++ to run on an embedded platform with or without a real-time operating system
Optimize algorithms to maximize performance and minimize power consumption in challenging platforms
Perform design analysis, characterization and validation for touchscreen hardware designs in product strategy reviews
Perform advanced technical research on new touch sensors and technologies for use in future products and develop prototypes to demo those technologies with the team
Work with electronic prototypes at a bench, using an oscilloscope and other test equipment and collaboratively with other engineers to solve challenging system integration issues


Candidates for this role should possess a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Math or Physics or another relevant engineering/technical field AND a minimum of 5 year relevant experience OR Master of Science Degree in any of the fields noted above AND a minimum of 3 years relevant experience OR an equivalent combination of education and relevant experience plus a cumulative GPA greater than or equal to 3.0 as a general rule.
