Requires some engineering supervision experience in design or R&D of HVAC or Refrigeration products or components for HVAC/R applications.
Position is open due to exceptional growth of the company; not only in 2017 but for several years in a roll. Bonuses were paid at 150% of schedule due to the outstanding 2017 business year.
This engineering manager will enter the company leading the design engineering group of 3-4 design engineers and within 6 – 12 months as you become knowledgeable about company’s products and business will become engineering manager of Research and Development Engineering along with Design Engineering. The engineering department is made up of very talented engineers who need solid leadership in directing them.
 A few of your responsibilities include: Providing new and improved products to the market that will lead to division growth. Provide technical assistance and coordinate research activities to support other department functions. Assure that projects are managed to meet product launch schedule timelines. Assist in the establishment of the company’s long-range product development goals and objectives.    Remain aware and knowledgeable of current technological progress to ensure the company’s products remain marketable and competitive.
This corporation is regarded year after year as number one in their industry market segment. This requires them to constantly bring new devices to the market to meet ever-changing customer needs. While the company has 10+ locations this TN location is the flagship operation for their flow control products, which is their leading product line. Hence, you will not only interface with all dept mgrs such as marketing, sales, materials, controller, etc but will have excellent visibility and can be on a fast promotional track. This is a company that hires and believes in achievers. You do not have to have experience of doing something ten times to be good at it. They seek people who have good communications and have a high level of energy and drive and take ownership of their work. Definitely, not a company where engineers are micro-managed. This corporation offers the best of both worlds from the standpoint of its size. As a one billion dollar per year company it has enough size and resources to be a good company to work for but it is not so large for an engineer to get lost in the organization; you won’t just be another number. 
Company has been growing by expanding the company via new products lines internally and also by expanding by acquisition of other companies, Company has a good set of benefits including relocation for a new hire.
