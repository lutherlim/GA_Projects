The growing demand for statistically based test and evaluation (T&E) in the Department of Defense (DOD) has increased the demand for skilled applied statisticians. DOD leadership requires the integration of more scientific and statistical methods and processes (known as Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques [STAT] in the DOD) to develop efficient, rigorous test strategies that yield defensible results and assist the decision maker in understanding and quantifying technical risk.

Assist with and potentially lead the development of test strategies, technical test designs, and post-test analysis.      Employ various techniques and methods such as design of experiments, Bayesian techniques, regression modeling, reliability planning and modeling, sampling methodologies, data mining, and covering arrays. Employ statistical software (e.g. JMP, DesignExpert, R, Matlab or equivalent) to create designs, analyze results, and create tools for practitioners. Engage and mentor program T&E practitioners in STAT processes and technical test design and execution.      Communicate solutions to leadership both orally and in writing; clearly, concisely, and with technical accuracy. Provide specific recommendations, best practices, case studies, and lessons learned regarding test planning, execution, and analysis focused on optimizing return from test resources.

The growing demand for statistically based test and evaluation (T&E) in the Department of Defense (DOD) has increased the demand for skilled applied statisticians. DOD leadership requires the integration of more scientific and statistical methods and processes (known as Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques [STAT] in the DOD) to develop efficient, rigorous test strategies that yield defensible results and assist the decision maker in understanding and quantifying technical risk. The DOD employs T&E teams across the United States to evaluate performance for new, developing systems as well as fielded systems. Every system is required to efficiently and effectively demonstrate performance against specific technical and operational requirements. This position resides in the DOD Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE) and provides program leadership with technical test design support for major DOD systems across all services. The STAT COE has provided invaluable support to T&E programs since its inception in 2012 and is seeking applied statisticians to employ statistical methods to develop test strategies, create technical test designs, and conduct post-test analysis. As a member of the STAT COE you will support multiple programs as a statistical expert and consultant. This position requires a self-starter capable of mentoring test teams on statistical test design processes and delivering designs and test strategy products. You will be challenged to adapt methods and guidelines to specific program requirements, especially in instances where no closely related precedent exists. The STAT COE is looking for candidates across various degree fields and with diverse backgrounds. Both degree level and experience will be considered for placement (the three levels are explicitly listed in the requirements section below). There are tremendous professional growth opportunities to improve your technical knowledge, practical skills, and broaden your experience. The COE is a collaborative and supportive environment where members solicit advice, discuss program challenges, leverage diverse experiences, and work together to provide practical and insightful products to programs. Vision, imagination, creativity, and sound judgment are encouraged. The STAT COE is a high performing team that enables you to deliver high quality products to the programs we support. The STAT COE is headquartered at the Air Force Institute of Technology in Dayton, Ohio at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.STAT COE members perform the following activities: Provide statistical/T&E subject matter expertise to DOD programs over five warfare domains (land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace). Assist with and potentially lead the development of test strategies, technical test designs, and post-test analysis.      Employ various techniques and methods such as design of experiments, Bayesian techniques, regression modeling, reliability planning and modeling, sampling methodologies, data mining, and covering arrays. Employ statistical software (e.g. JMP, DesignExpert, R, Matlab or equivalent) to create designs, analyze results, and create tools for practitioners. Engage and mentor program T&E practitioners in STAT processes and technical test design and execution.      Communicate solutions to leadership both orally and in writing; clearly, concisely, and with technical accuracy. Provide specific recommendations, best practices, case studies, and lessons learned regarding test planning, execution, and analysis focused on optimizing return from test resources. Potential to present at technical conferences (Military Operations Research Society, Fall Technical Conference, NASA/Institute for Defense Analyses spring conference, International Test and Evaluation Association, Joint Statistical Meeting). Potential to teach one to five day short courses on rigorous T&E methods.

NSA Overview 

The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation.  The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense.  The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.  The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. 

At NSA, mathematics and statistics are core disciplines and are present in every aspect of the mission.  

Mathematical Statisticians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, regression, machine learning, exploratory data analysis, stochastic processes, and statistical modeling and forecasting.  They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and cybersecurity (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). 

Mathematical Statisticians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.  

Description of Position

NSA is actively seeking mathematical statisticians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals.

Newly-hired mathematical statisticians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP).  The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematical statisticians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA.  To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices.  Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.

The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Statistics.  In addition to cryptologic mathematics, statisticians work in: 

- Signals analysis
- Data compression
- Machine learning 
- Data science
- Human language technology
- Speech/image/video processing
- Analysis of communication networks
- Network vulnerability analysis
- Cybersecurity 

Additionally, computing is an essential component of the mathematical sciences at NSA and statisticians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematical statistician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.
Skills
Candidates should possess: 

- Strong problem-solving and analytical abilities
- Desire for continual learning
- Ability to work effectively independently and within teams across functional areas  

Knowledge and experience in one or more of the following is desired, but not required:  

- Programming expertise
- Experience in the design, development, use, and evaluation of mathematics models, methods, and/or techniques (e.g., algorithm development) to study issues and solve problems


Salary Range:  $69,545 - $86,659 (Entry/Developmental) 

*The qualifications listed are the minimum acceptable to be considered for the position.  Salary offers are based on candidates' education level and years of experience relevant to the position and also take into account information provided by the hiring manager/organization regarding the work level for the position.
